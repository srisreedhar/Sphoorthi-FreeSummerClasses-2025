Gregory,  on  my  word,  we\\'ll  not  carry  coals. \\n\\nGregory.  No,  for  then  we  should  be  colliers. \\n\\nSampson.  I  mean,  an  we  be  in  choler,  we\\'ll  draw. \\n\\nGregory.  Ay,  while  you  live,  draw  your  neck  out  o\\' \\nthe  collar. \\n\\nSam.pson.  I  strike  quickly,  being  moved. \\n\\nGregory.  But  thou  art  not  quickly  moved  to  strike. \\n\\nSampson.  A  dog  of  the  house  of  Montague  moves  me. \\n\\nGregory.  To  move  is  to  stir,  and  to  be  valiant  is  to \\nstand ;  therefore,  if  thou  art  moved,  thou  runn\\'st  away. \\n\\nSampson.  A  dog  of  that  house  shall  move  me  to  stand; \\nI  will  take  the  wall  of  any  man  or  maid  of  Montague\\'s. \\n\\nGregory.  That  shows  thee  a  weak  slave ;  for  the  weak- \\nest goes  to  the  wall. \\n\\nSampson.  True;  and  therefore  women,  being  the  weaker \\nvessels,  are  ever  thrust  to  the  wall :  therefore  I  will  push \\n\\n9 \\n\\n\\n10  BOMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nMontague\\'s  men  from  the  wall,  and  thrust  his  maids  to \\nthe  wall. \\n\\nGregory.  The  quarrel  is  between  our  masters  and  us \\ntheir  men. \\n\\nSampson.  \\'Tis  all  one,  I  will  show  myself  a  tyrant ; \\nwhen  I  have  fought  with  the  men,  I  will  be  cruel  with \\nthe  maids,  and  cut  oif  their  heads. \\n\\nGregory.  Draw  thy  tool ;  here  comes  two  of  the  house \\nof  the  Montagues. \\n\\nSampson.  My  naked  weapon  is  out;  quarrel,  I  will \\nback  thee. \\n\\nGregory.  How  ?  turn  thy  back  and  run  ? \\n\\nSampson.  Fear  me  not. \\n\\nGregory.  No,  marry ;  I  fear  thee  ! \\n\\nSampson.  Let  us  take  the  law  of  our  sides ;  let  them \\nbegin. \\n\\nGregory.  T  will  frown  as  I  pass  by,  and  let  them  take \\nit  as  they  list. \\n\\nSampson.  Nay,  as  they  dare.  I  will  bite  my  thumb \\nat  them ;  which  is  a  disgrace  to  them,  if  they  bear  it. \\n\\nEnter  Abram  and  Balthasak. \\n\\nAbram.  Do  you  bite  your  thumb  at  us,  sir  ? \\nSampson.  I  do  bite  my  thumb,  sir. \\nAbram.  Do  you  bite  your  thumb  at  us,  sir  ? \\nSampson.

What,  ho !  you  men,  you  beasts, \\n\\nThat  quench  the  fire  of  your  pernicious  rage \\n\\nWith  purple  fountains  issuing  from  your  veins, \\n\\nOn  pain  of  torture,  from  those  bloody  hands \\n\\nThrow  your  mistemper\\'d  weapons  to  the  ground, \\n\\nAnd  hear  the  sentence  of  your  moved  prince.  — \\n\\nThree  civil  brawls,  bred  of  an  airy  word. \\n\\nBy  thee,  old  Capulet,  and  Montague, \\n\\nHave  thrice  disturbed  the  quiet  of  our  streets, \\n\\nAnd  made  Verona\\'s  ancient  citizens \\n\\nCast  by  their  grave  beseeming  ornaments. \\n\\nTo  wield  old  partisans,  in  hands  as  old, \\n\\nCanker\\'d  with  peace,  to  part  your  canker\\'d  hate. \\n\\nIf  ever  you  disturb  our  streets  again. \\n\\nYour  lives  shall  pay  the  forfeit  of  the  peace. \\n\\nFor  this  time,  all  the  rest  depart  away : \\n\\nYou,  Capulet,  shall  go  along  with  me ; \\n\\nAnd,  Montague,  come  you  this  afternoon, \\n\\nTo  know  our  further  pleasure  in  this  case, \\n\\nTo  old  Freetown,  our  common  judgment-place. \\n\\nOnce  more,  on  pain  of  death,  all  men  depart. \\n\\n^Exeunt  all  but  Montague,  Lady  3Iontague,  and  Benvolio. \\n\\nMontague.  Who  set  this  ancient  quarrel  new  abroach  ? \\nSpeak,  nephew,  were  you  by  when  it  began  ? \\n\\nBenvolio.  Here  were  the  servants  of  your  adversary \\nAnd  yours  close  fighting  ere  I  did  approach. \\nI  drew  to  part  them :  in  the  instant  came \\n\\n\\n14-  BOMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nThe  fiery  Tybalt,  with  his  sword  prepar\\'d ; \\nWhich,  as  he  breath\\'d  defiance  to  my  ears, \\nHe  swung  about  his  head  and  cut  the  winds, \\nWho,  nothing  hurt  withal,  hiss\\'d  him  in  scorn. \\nWhile  we  were  interchanging  thrusts  and  blows. \\nCame  more  and  more,  and  fought  on  part  and  part. \\nTill  the  prince  came,  who  parted  either  part. \\n\\nLady  Montague.  0,  where  is  Eomeo  ?  saw  you  him \\nto-day  ? \\nRight  glad  I  am  he  was  not  at  this  fray. \\n\\nBenvolio.  Madam,  an  hour  before  the  worshipp\\'d  sun \\nPeer\\'d  forth  the  golden  window  of  the  east, \\nA  troubled  mind  drave  me  to  walk  abroad ; \\nWhere,  underneath  the  grove  of  sycamore \\nThat  westward  rooteth  from  the  city\\'s  side. \\nSo  early  walking  did  I  see  your  son. \\nTowards  him  I  made,  but  he  was  ware  of  me \\nAnd  stole  into  the  covert  of  the  wood ; \\nI,  measuring  his  affections  by  my  own. \\nWhich  then  most  sought  where  most  might  not  be  found, \\nBeing  one  too  many  by  my  weary  self, \\nPursued  my  humor  not  pursuing  his. \\nAnd  gladly  shunn\\'d  who  gladly  fled  from  me. \\n\\nMontague.  Many  a  morning  hath  he  there  been  seen \\nWith  tears  augmenting  the  fresh  morning\\'s  dew, \\nAdding  to  clouds  more  clouds  with  his  deep  sighs  ; \\nBut  all  so  soon  as  the  all-cheering  sun \\n\\n\\nROMEO  AND  JULIET.  15 \\n\\nShould  in  the  farthest  east  begin  to  draw \\nThe  shady  curtains  from  Aurora\\'s  bea, \\nAway  from  light  steals  home  my  heavy  son, \\nAnd  private  in  his  chamber  pens  himself, \\nShuts  up  his  window,  locks  fair  daylight  out, \\nAnd  makes  himself  an  ar|;ificial  night. \\nBlack  and  portentous  must  this  humor  prove. \\nUnless  good  counsel  may  the  cause  remove. \\n\\nBenvolio.  My  noble  uncle,  do  you  know  the  cause  ? \\n\\nMontague.  I  neither  know  it  nor  can  learn  of  him. \\n\\nBenvolio.  Have  you  importun\\'d  him  by  any  means  ? \\n\\nMontague.  Both  by  myself  and  many  other  friends ; \\nBut  he,  his  own  affections\\'  counsellor. \\nIs  to  himself  —  I  will  not  say  how  true  — \\nBut  to  himself  so  secret  and  sd  close, \\nSo  far  from  sounding  and  discovery. \\nAs  is  the  bud  bit  with  an  envious  worm, \\nEre  he  can  spread  his  sweet  leaves  to  the  air, \\nOr  dedicate  his  beauty  to  the  sun. \\nCould  we  but  learn  from  whence  his  sorrows  grow \\nWe  would  as  willingly  give  cure  as  know. \\n\\nEnter  Eomeo. \\n\\nBenvolio.  See,  where  he  comes :   so  please  you,  step \\naside ; \\nI\\'ll  know  his  grievance,  or  be  much  deniea. \\n\\n\\n15\\'  BOMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nMontague.  I  would  tliou  wert  so  happy  by  tliy  stay, \\nTo  hear  true  slirif t.  —  Come,  madam,  let\\'s  away. \\n\\n[^Exeunt  Montague  and  Lady. \\n\\nBenvolio.  Good  morrow,  cousin. \\n\\nRomeo.  Is  the  day  so  young  ? \\n\\nBenvolio.  But  new  struck  nine. \\n\\nRomeo.  Ay  me  !  sad  hours  seem  long. \\n\\nWas  that  my  father  that  went  hence  so  fast  ? \\n\\nBenvolio.  It  was.     What  sadness  lengthens   Borneo\\'s \\nhours  ? \\n\\nRomeo.  Not  having  that  which,  having,  makes  them \\nshort. \\n\\nBenvolio.  In  love  ? \\n\\nRomeo.  Out  — \\n\\nBenvolio.  Of  love  ? \\n\\nRomeo.  Out  of  her  favor,  where  I  am  in  love. \\n\\nBenvolio.  Alas,  that  love,  so  gentle  in  his  view, \\nShould  be  so  tyrannous  and  rough  in  proof ! \\n\\nRomeo.  Alas,  that  love,  whose  view  is  muffled  still, \\nShould  without  eyes  see  pathways  to  his  will ! \\nWhere  si:  all  we  dine  ?  —  O  me  !  what  fray  was  here  ? \\nYet  tell  me  not,  for  I  have  heard  it  all. \\nHere\\'s  much  to  do  with  hate,  but  more  with  love. \\nWhy,  then,  0  brawling  love  !  0  loving  hate  ! \\nO  anything,  of  nothing  first  created ! \\n0  heavy  lightness  !  serious  vanity ! \\nIMisshapen  chaos  of  well-seeming  forms \\' \\n\\n\\nROMEO  AND  JULIET.  17 \\n\\nFeather  of  lead,  bright  smoke,  cold  fire,  sick  health ! \\nStill-waking  sleep,  that  is  not  what  it  is ! \\nThis  love  feel  I,  that  feel  no  love  in  this. \\nDost  thou  not  laugh  ? \\n\\nBenvolw,  No,  coz,  I  rather  weep. \\n\\nRomeo.  Good  heart,  at  what  ? \\n\\nBenvolio.  At  thy  good  heart\\'s  oppression. \\n\\nRomeo.  Why,  such  is  love\\'s  transgression. \\nGriefs  of  mine  own  lie  heavy  in  my  breast, \\nWhich  thou  wilt  propagate,  to  have  it  prest \\nWith  more  of  thine ;  this  love  that  thou  hast  shown \\nDoth  add  more  grief  to  too  much  of  mine  own. \\nLove  is  a  smoke  rais\\'d  with  the  fume  of  sighs : \\nBeing  purg\\'d,  a  fire  sparkling  in  lovers\\'  eyes ; \\nBeing  vex\\'d,  a  sea  nourish\\'d  with  lovers\\'  tears ; \\nWhat  is  it  else  ?  a  madness  most  discreet, \\nA  choking  gall,  and  a  preserving  sweet. \\nFarewell,  my  coz. \\n\\nBenvolio.  Soft !  I  will  go  along ; \\n\\nAn  if  you  leave  me  so,  you  do  me  wrong. \\n\\nRomeo.  Tut,  I  have  lost  myself  ;  I  am  not  here : \\nThis  is  not  Romeo,  he\\'s  some  other  where. \\n\\nBenvolio.  Tell  me  in  sadness  who  is  that  you  love. \\n\\nRomeo.  What,  shall  I  groan  and  tell  thee  ? \\n\\nBenvolio.  Groan  !  why,  no  ; \\n\\nBut  sadly  tell  me  who. \\n\\nRomeo.  Bid  a  sick  man  in  sadness  make  his  will; \\n\\n\\n18  ROMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nAh,  word  ill  urg\\'d  to  one  that  is  so  ill ! \\nIn  sadness,  cousin,  I  do  love  a  woman. \\n\\nBenvolio.  I  aini\\'d  so  near  when  I  suppos\\'d  you  lov\\'d. \\n\\nRomeo.  A  right  good  mark-man  !    And  she\\'s  fair  I  love. \\n\\nBenvolio.

Not  I,  believe  me.     You  have  dancing  shoes \\nWith  nimble  soles ;  I  have  a  soul  of  lead \\nSo  stakes  me  to  the  ground  I  cannot  move. \\n\\n\\n28  ROMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nMercutio.  You  are  a  lover ;  borrow  Cupid\\'s  wings, \\nAnd  soar  with  them  above  a  common  bound. \\n\\nRomeo.  I  am  too  sore  enpierced  with  his  shaft \\nTo  soar  Avith  his  light  feathers,  and,  so  bound, \\nI  cannot  bound  a  pitch  above  dull  woe ; \\nUnder  love\\'s  heavy  burden  do  I  sink. \\n\\nMercutio.  And,  to  sink  in  it,  should  you  burden  love ; \\nToo  great  oppression  for  a  tender  thing. \\n\\nRomeo.  Is  love  a  tender  thing  ?  it  is  too  rough, \\nToo  rude,  too  boisterous,  and  it  pricks  like  thorn. \\n\\nMercutio.  If  love  be  rough  with  you,  be  rough  with \\nlove; \\nPrick  love  for  pricking,  and  jovi  beat  love  down.  — \\nGive  me  a  case  to  put  my  visage  in ; \\n\\n\\\\_Putting  on  a  mask. \\nA  visor  for  a  visor  !  what  care  I \\nWhat  curious  eye  doth  quote  deformities  ? \\nHere  are  the  beetle-brows  shall  blush  for  me. \\n\\nBenvolio.

Nay,  that\\'s  not  so. \\n\\nMercutio.  I  mean,  sir,  in  delay \\n\\nWe  waste  our  lights  in  vain,  like  lamps  by  day. \\nTake  our  good  meaning,  for  our  judgment  sits \\nFive  times  in  that  ere  once  in  our  five  wits. \\n\\nBorneo.  And  we  mean  well  in  going  to  this  mask ; \\nBut  \\'tis  no  wit  to  go. \\n\\nMercutio.  Why,  may  one  ask  ? \\n\\nBorneo.  I  dreamt  a  dream  to-night. \\n\\nMercutio.  ^nd  so  did  I. \\n\\nRomeo.  Well,  what  was  yours  ? \\n\\nMercutio.  That  dreamers  often  lie. \\n\\nRovieo.

This  is  that  very  Mab \\n\\nThat  plats  the  manes  of  horses  in  the  night. \\n\\n\\nBOMEO  AND  JULIET.  31 \\n\\nAnd  bakes  the  elf-locks  in  fonl  sluttish  hairs, \\nWhich  once  untangled  much  misfortune  bodes. \\nThis  is  she  — \\n\\nRomeo.  Peace,  peace,  Mercutio,  peace  ! \\n\\nThou  talk\\'st  of  nothing. \\n\\nMercutio.  True,  I  talk  of  dreams, \\n\\nWhich  are  the  children  of  an  idle  brain, \\nBegot  of  nothing  but  vain  fantasy. \\nWhich  is  as  thin  of  substance  as  the  air, \\nAnd  more  inconstant  than  the  wind,  who  wooes \\nEven  now  the  frozen  bosom  of  the  North, \\nAnd,  being  anger\\'d,  puffs  away  from  thence, \\nTurning  his  face  to  the  dew-dropping  South. \\n\\nBenvolio.  This  wind  you  talk  of  blows  us  from  our- \\nselves ; \\nSupper  is  done,  and  we  shall  come  too  late. \\n\\nRomeo.  I  fear,  too  early  ;  for  my  mind  misgives \\nSome  consequence,  yet  hanging  in  the  stars, \\nShall  bitterly  begin  his  fearful  date \\nWith  this  night\\'s  revels,  and  expire  the  term \\nOf  a  despised  life  clos\\'d  in  my  breast \\nBy  some  vile  forfeit  of  untimely  death. \\nBut  He  that  hath  the  steerage  of  my  course \\nDirect  my  sail !  —  On,  lusty  gentlemen. \\n\\nBenvolio.

Thou  ! \\nwhy,  thou  wilt  quarrel  with  a  num  that  hath  a  hair \\nmore,  or  a  hair  less,  in  his  beard  than  thou  hast.

Thou  hast  quarrelled  with  a  man  for \\ncoughing  in  the  street,  because  he  hath  wakened  thy  dog \\nthat  hath  lain  asleep  in  the  sun.  Didst  thou  not  fall  out \\nwith  a  tailor  for  wearing  his  new  doublet  before  Easter  ? \\nwith  another,  for  tying  his  new  shoes  with  old  riband  ? \\nand  yet  thou  wilt  tutor  me  from  quarrelling ! \\n\\nBenvolio.  An  I  were  so  apt  to  quarrel  as  thou  art,  any \\nman  should  buy  the  fee-simple  of  my  life  for  an  hour \\nand  a  quarter. \\n\\nMercutio.

It  was  the  lark,  the  herald  of  the  morn, \\nNo  nightingale ;  look,  love,  what  envious  streaks \\nDo  lace  the  severing  clouds  in  yonder  east. \\nNight\\'s  candies  are  burnt  out,  and  jocund  day \\nStands  tiptoe  on  the  misty  mountain  tops. \\nI  must  be  gone  and  live,  or  stay  and  die. \\n\\nJuliet.  Yon  light  is  not  day-light,  I  know  it,  I ; \\nIt  is  some  meteor  that  the  sun  exhales. \\nTo  be  to  thee  this  night  a  torch-bearer. \\nAnd  light  thee  on  thy  way  to  Mantua : \\nTherefore  stay  yet,  thou  need\\'st  not  to  be  gone. \\n\\nBorneo.

Juliet  wills  it  so. \\nHow  is\\'t,  my  soul  ?  let\\'s  talk,  it  is  not  day. \\n\\nJuliet.  It  is,  it  is  ;  hie  hence,  be  gone,  away ! \\nIt  is  the  lark  that  sings  so  out  of  tune. \\nStraining  harsh  discords  and  unpleasing  sharps. \\nSome  say  the  lark  makes  sweet  division ; \\n\\n\\nROMEO  AND  JULIET.  9^ \\n\\nThis  doth  not  so,  for  she  divideth  us. \\nSome  say  the  lark  and  loathed  toad  change  eyes ; \\n0,  now  I  Avould  they  had  chang\\'d  voices  too  ! \\nSince  arm  from  arm  that  voice  doth  us  affray, \\nHunting  thee  hence  with  hunt\\'s-np  to  the  day. \\nO,  now  be  gone ;  more  light  and  light  it  grows. \\n\\nBorneo.

I  doubt  it  not;  and  all  these  woes  shall  serve \\nFor  sweet  discourses  in  our  time  to  come. \\n\\n\\n92  EOMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nJuliet.  0  God,  I  have  an  ill-divining  soul ! \\n]\\\\rethinks  I  see  thee,  now  thou  art  below, \\nAs  one  dead  in  the  bottom  of  a  tomb  ; \\nEither  my  eyesight  fails,  or  thou  look\\'st  pale. \\n\\nBorneo.

Yet  let  me  weep  for  such  a  feeling  loss. \\n\\n\\nROMEO  AND  JULIET.  93 \\n\\nLadf/  Capulet.  So  shall  you  feel  the  loss,  but  not  the \\nfriend \\nWhich  you  weep  for. \\n\\nJuliet.  Feeling  so  the  loss, \\n\\nI  cannot  choose  but  ever  weep  the  friend. \\n\\nLady  Capulet.  Well,  girl,  thou  weep\\'st  not  so  much \\nfor  his  death \\nAs  that  the  villain  lives  which  slaughter\\'d  him. \\nJuliet.  What  villain,  madam  ? \\n\\nLady  Capulet.  That  same  villain,  Eomeo. \\n\\nJuliet.  Villain  and  he  be  many  miles  asunder.  — \\nGod  pardon  him  !  I  do,  with  all  my  heart ; \\nAnd  yet  no  man  like  he  doth  grieve  my  heart. \\n\\nLady  Capulet.  That  is,  because  the  traitor  murderer \\n\\nlives. \\nJuliet.  Ay,  madam,  from  the  reach  of  these  my  hands. \\nWould  none  but  I  might  venge  my  cousin\\'s  death  ! \\nLady  Capulet.  We  will  have  vengeance  for  it,  fear \\nthou  not ; \\nThen  weep  no  more.     I\\'ll  send  to  one  in  Mantua, \\nWhere  that  same  banish\\'d  runagate  doth  live, \\nShall  give  him  such  an  unaccustom\\'d  dram, \\nThat  he  shall  soon  keep  Tybalt  company  ; \\nAnd  then,  I  hope,  thou  wilt  be  satisfied. \\n\\nJuliet.  Indeed,  I  never  shall  be  satisfied \\nWith  Eomeo,  till  I  behold  him  —  dead  — \\nIs  my  poor  heart  so  for  a  kinsman  vex\\'d.  — \\n\\n\\n94  BOMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nMadam,  if  you  could  find  out  but  a  man \\nTo  bear  a  poison,  I  would  temper  it, \\nThat  Romeo  should,  upon  receipt  thereof. \\nSoon  sleep  in  quiet.     0,  how  my  heart  abhors \\nTo  hear  him  nam\\'d,  and  cannot  come  to  him, \\nTo  wreak  the  love  I  bore  my  cousin \\nUpon  his  body  that  hath  slaughter\\'d  him ! \\n\\nLacli/  Capulet.

My  father  Capulet  will  have  it  so ; \\nAnd  I  am  nothing  slow  to  slack  his  haste. \\n\\nFriar  Laurence.  You  say  you  do  not  know  the  lady\\'s \\nmind; \\nUneven  is  the  course,  I  like  it  not. \\n\\nParis.  Immoderately  she  weeps  for  Tybalt\\'s  death, \\nAnd  therefore  have  I  little  talk\\'d  of  love ; \\nFor  Venus  smiles  not  in  a  house  of  tears. \\nNow,  sir,  her  father  counts  it  dangerous \\nThat  she  doth  give  her  sorrow  so  much  sway, \\nAnd  in  his  wisdom  hastes  our  marriage, \\nTo  stop  the  inundation  of  her  tears. \\nWhich,  too  much  minded  by  herself  alone, \\nMay  be  put  from  her  by  society. \\nNow  do  you  know  the  reason  of  this  haste. \\n\\nFriar  Laurence.  [Aside\\']  I  would  I  knew  not  why  it \\nshould  be  slow\\'d. \\nLook,  sir,  here  comes  the  lady  towards  my  cell. \\n\\n101 \\n\\n\\n102  ROMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nEnter  Juliet. \\n\\nParis.

What  must  be  shall  be. \\n\\nFriar  Laurence.  That\\'s  a  certain  text. \\n\\nParis.  Come  you  to  make  confession  to  this  father  ? \\n\\nJuliet.  To  answer  that,  I  should  confess  to  you. \\n\\nParis.  Do  not  deny  to  him  that  you  love  me. \\n\\nJuliet.  I  will  confess  to  you  that  I  love  him. \\n\\nParis.  So  will  you,  I  am  sure,  that  you  love  me. \\n\\nJidiet.  If  I  do  so,  it  will  be  of  more  price. \\nBeing  spoke  behind  your  back,  than  to  your  face. \\n\\nParis.  Poor  soul,  thy  face  is  much  abus\\'d  with  tears. \\n\\nJuliet.  The  tears  have  got  small  victory  by  that ; \\nFor  it  was  bad  enough  before  their  spite. \\n\\nParis.  Thou  wrong\\'st  it  more  than  tears  with  tliat   re- \\nport. \\n\\nJuliet.  That  is  no  slander,  sir,  which  is  a  truth ; \\nAnd  what  I  spake,  I  spake  it  to  my  face. \\n\\nParis.  Thy  face  is  mine,  and  thou  hast  slander\\'d  it. \\n\\nJuliet.  It  may  be  so,  for  it  is  not  mine  own.  — \\nAre  you  at  leisure,  holy  father,  now  ; \\nOr  shall  I  come  to  you  at  evening  mass  ? \\n\\nFriar  Laurence.  My  leisure  serves  me,  pensive  daugh- \\ntei\\',  now. — \\nMy  lord,  we  mast  entreat  the  time  alone. \\n\\n\\nROMEO  AND  JULIET.  103 \\n\\nParis.

Ah,  Juliet,  I  already  know  thy  grief ; \\nIt  strains  me  past  the  compass  of  my  wits : \\nI  hear  thou  must,  and  nothing  may  prorogue  it, \\nOn  Thursday  next  be  married  to  this  county. \\n\\nJuliet.  Tell  me  not,  friar,  that  thou  hear\\'st  of  this, \\nUnless  thou  tell  me  how  I  may  prevent  it; \\nIf  in  thy  wisdom  thou  canst  give  no  help, \\nDo  thou  but  call  my  resolution  wise. \\nAnd  with  this  knife  I\\'ll  help  it  presently. \\nGod  join\\'d  my  heart  and  Romeo\\'s,  thou  our  hands ; \\nAnd  ere  this  hand,  by  thee  to  Romeo  seai\\'d, \\nShall  be  the  label  to  another  deed. \\nOr  my  true  heart  with  treacherous  revolt \\nTurn  to  another,  this  shall  slay  them  botli : \\nTherefore,  out  of  thy  long-experienc\\'d  time, \\nGive  me  some  present  counsel,  or,  behold, \\n\\'Twixt  my  extremes  and  me  this  bloody  knife \\nShall  play  the  umpire,  arbitrating  that \\nWhich  the  commission  of  thy  years  and  art \\nCould  to  no  issue  of  true  honor  bring. \\nBe  not  so  long  to  speak  j  I  long  to  die, \\nIf  what  thou  speak\\'st  speak  not  of  remedy. \\n\\n\\n104  ROMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nFriar  Laurence.  Hold,  daughter !  I  do  spy  a  kind  of \\nhope, \\nWhich  craves  as  desperate  an  execution \\nAs  that  is  desperate  which  we  would  prevent. \\nIf,  rather  than  to  marry  County  Paris, \\nThou  hast  the  strength  of  will  to  slay  thyself, \\nThen  is  it  likely  thou  wilt  undertake \\nA  thing  like  death  to  chide  away  this  shame. \\nThat  cop\\'st  with  death  himself  to  scape  from  it ; \\nAnd  if  thou  dar\\'st,  I\\'ll  give  thee  remedy. \\n\\nJuliet.  0,  bid  me  leap,  rather  than  marry  Paris, \\nErom  off  the  hattlements  of  yonder  tower ; \\nOr  walk  in  thievish  ways  ;  or  bid  me  lurk \\nWhere  serpents  are ;  chain  me  with  roaring  bears ; \\nOr  shut  me  nightly  in  a  charnel-house, \\nO\\'ercover\\'d  quite  with  dead  men\\'s  rattling  bones, \\nWith  reeky  shanks  and  yellow  chapless  skulls  j \\nOr  bid  me  go  into  a  new-made  grave \\nAnd  hide  me  with  a  dead  man  in  his  shroud ; \\nThings  that,  to  hear  them  told,  have  made  me  tremble ; \\nAnd  I  will  do  it  without  fear  or  doubt, \\nTo  live  an  unstain\\'d  wife  to  my  sweet  love. \\n\\nFriar  Laurence.  Hold,  then  ;  go  home,  be  merry,  give \\nconsent \\nTo  marry  Paris.

I  will  be  brief,  for  my  short  date  of \\nbreath \\nIs  not  so  long  as  is  a  tedious  tale. \\nRomeo,  there  dead,  was  husband  to  that  Juliet; \\nAnd  she,  there  dead,  that  Eomeo\\'s  faithful  wife. \\n\\n\\n136  BOMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nI  married  them  ;  and  their  stolen  marriage-day \\n\\nWas  Tybalt\\'s  doomsday,  whose  untimely  death \\n\\nBanish\\'d  the  new-made  bridegroom  from  this  city, \\n\\nFor  whom,  and  not  for  Tybalt,  Juliet  pin\\'d. \\n\\nYou,  to  remove  that  siege  of  grief  from  her, \\n\\nBetroth\\'d  and  would  have  married  her  perforce \\n\\nTo  County  Paris ;  then  comes  she  to  me. \\n\\nAnd  with  wild  looks  bid  me  devise  some  means \\n\\nTo  rid  her  from  this  second  marriage. \\n\\nOr  in  my  cell  there  would  she  kill  herself. \\n\\nThen  gave  I  her,  so  tutor\\'d  by  my  art, \\n\\nA  sleeping  potion ;  which  so  took  effect \\n\\nAs  I  intended,  for  it  wrought  on  her \\n\\nThe  form  of  death :  meantime  I  writ  to  Eomeo, \\n\\nThat  he  should  hither  come  as  this  dire  night, \\n\\nTo  help  to  take  her  from  her  borrow\\'d  grave, \\n\\nBeing  the  time  the  potion\\'s  force  should  cease. \\n\\nBut  he  which  bore  my  letter,  Friar  John, \\n\\nWas  stay\\'d  by  accident,  and  yesternight \\n\\nReturn\\'d  my  letter  back.     Then  all  alone. \\n\\nAt  the  prefixed  hour  of  her  waking. \\n\\nCame  I  to  take  her  from  her  kindred\\'s  vault, \\n\\nMeaning  to  keep  her  closely  at  my  cell \\n\\nTill  I  conveniently  could  send  to  Romeo ; \\n\\nBut  when  I  came,  some  minute  ere  the  time \\n\\nOf  her  awaking,  here  untimely  lay \\n\\nThe  noble  Paris  and  true  Romeo  dead. \\n\\n\\nROMEO  AND  JULIET.  137 \\n\\nShe  wakes,  and  I  entreated  her  come  forth, \\nAnd  bear  this  work  of  heaven  with  patience ; \\nBut  then  a  noise  did  scare  me  from  the  tomb. \\nAnd  she  too  desperate  would  not  go  with  me, \\nBut,  as  it  seems,  did  violence  on  herself. \\nAll  this  I  know ;  and  to  the  marriage \\nHer  nurse  is  privy  :  and,  if  aught  in  this \\nMiscarried  by  my  fault,  let  my  old  life \\nBe  sacrific\\'d  some  hour  before  his  time \\nUnto  the  rigor  of  severest  law. \\n\\nPrince.  We  still  have  known  thee  for  a  holy  man.  — \\nWhere\\'s  Romeo\\'s  man  ?  what  can  he  say  in  this  ? \\n\\nBalthasar.   I   brought   my   master   news   of    Juliet\\'s \\ndeath, \\nAnd  then  in  post  he  came  from  Mantua \\nTo  this  same  place,  to  this  same  monument. \\nThis  letter  he  early  bid  me  give  his  father, \\nAnd  threaten\\'d  me  with  death,  going  in  the  vault, \\nIf  I  departed  not  and  left  him  there. \\n\\nPrince.  Give  me  the  letter ;  I  will  look  on  it.  — \\nWhere  is  the  county\\'s  page  that  rais\\'d  the  watch  ?  — \\nSirrah,  what  made  your  master  in  this  place  ? \\n\\nPage.  He  came  with  flowers  to  strew  his  lady\\'s  grave ; \\nAnd  bid  me  stand  aloof,  and  so  I  did. \\nAnon  comes  one  with  light  to  ope  the  tomb, \\nAnd  by  and  by  my  master  drew  on  him ; \\nAnd  then  I  ran  away  to  call  the  watch. \\n\\n\\n138  ROMEO  AND  JULIET. \\n\\nPrince.  This  letter  doth  make  good  the  friar\\'s  words \\nTheir  course  of  love,  the  tidings  of  her  death ; \\nAnd  here  he  writes  that  he  did  buy  a  poison \\nOf  a  poor  apothecary,  and  therewithal \\nCame  to  this  vault  to  die  and  lie  with  Juliet.  — \\nWhere  be  these  enemies  ?  —  Capulet !  —  Montague  ! \\nSee,  what  a  scourge  is  laid  upon  your  hate, \\nThat  heaven  finds  means  to  kill  your  joys  with  love ! \\nAnd  I,  for  winking  at  your  discords  too. \\nHave  lost  a  brace  of  kinsmen ;  all  are  punish\\'d. \\n\\nCapulet.  0  brother  Montague,  give  me  thy  hand ; \\nThis  is  my  daughter\\'s  jointure,  for  no  more \\nCan  I  demand. \\n\\nMontague.         But  I  can  give  thee  more ; \\nFor  I  will  raise  her  statue  in  pure  gold. \\nThat  while  Verona  by  that  name  is  known \\nThere  shall  no  figure  at  such  rate  be  set \\nAs  that  of  true  and  faithful  Juliet. \\n\\nCapulet.  As  rich  shall  Eomeo  by  his  lady  lie ; \\nPoor  sacrifices  of  our  enmity  ! \\n\\nPrince.  A  glooming  peace  this  morning  with  it  brings ; \\n\\nThe  sun  for  sorrow  will  not  show  his  head. \\nGo  hence,  to  have  more  talk  of  these  sad  things ; \\n\\nSome  shall  be  pardon\\'d,  and  some  punished : \\nFor  never  was  a  story  of  more  woe \\nThan  this  of  Juliet  and  her  Komeo.  \\\\_Exeunt. \\n\\n\\n-BAp\\'05 \\n\\n\\n'"
