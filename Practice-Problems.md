# Python lists

---

### 1. **Create and Modify a List**
**Problem**: Write a Python program to create a list of 5 favorite fruits, then:
- Add a new fruit to the end of the list.
- Insert a fruit at the second position.
- Remove one fruit by its value.
- Print the final list.

**Apply these ->** : List creation, `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, basic list operations.

---

### 2. **Reverse a List**
**Problem**: Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the list in reverse order without using the built-in `reverse()` method or slicing (`[::-1]`).

**Hint**: Use a loop to create a new list by iterating from the end to the start.

**Apply these ->**: Loops, indexing, creating a new list.

---

### 3. **Find the Largest Number**
**Problem**: Write a program that takes a list of numbers (e.g., `[4, 2, 9, 7, 5]`) and finds the largest number in the list without using the `max()` function.

**Hint**: Initialize a variable with the first element and compare it with each element in the list.

**Apply these ->**: Iteration, comparison operators.

---

### 4. **Count Occurrences**
**Problem**: Write a function that takes a list and an element as input and returns how many times that element appears in the list. For example, for `["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange"]` and `"apple"`, return `2`.

**Apply these ->**: Loops, conditionals, counting elements.

---

### 5. **Remove Duplicates**
**Problem**: Write a program to remove duplicates from a list while preserving the order of the first occurrence of each element. For example, `[1, 3, 3, 4, 2, 1]` should become `[1, 3, 4, 2]`.

**Hint**: Use a loop and a new list, or consider using a set carefully to maintain order.

**Apply these ->**: Loops, sets (optional), list manipulation.

---

### 6. **List Slicing Practice**
**Problem**: Given a list of 10 numbers, write a program to:
- Extract the first 3 elements.
- Extract the last 4 elements.
- Extract every second element.
- Print all three results.

**Example Input**: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`

**Apply these ->**: List slicing, indexing.

---

### 7. **Sort a List Without `sort()`**
**Problem**: Write a function to sort a list of numbers in ascending order without using the built-in `sort()` or `sorted()` functions. Use a simple algorithm like bubble sort.

**Hint**: Compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order, repeating until no swaps are needed.

**Apply these ->**: Nested loops, swapping elements, basic sorting logic.

---

### 8. **Merge Two Lists**
**Problem**: Write a function that takes two lists and merges them into a single list, alternating elements. For example, `[1, 2, 3]` and `["a", "b", "c"]` should become `[1, "a", 2, "b", 3, "c"]`. Handle cases where lists have different lengths.

**Hint**: Use a loop with indexing and check the length of both lists.

**Apply these ->**: Loops, conditionals, list concatenation.

---

### 9. **List Comprehension**
**Problem**: Write a program that uses list comprehension to:
- Create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Create a list of even numbers from an input list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`).
- Create a list of strings from a list of numbers, appending "th" to each (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]` becomes `["1th", "2th", "3th"]`).

**Apply these ->**: List comprehension, string formatting.

---

### 10. **Rotate a List**
**Problem**: Write a function that rotates a list to the left by `n` positions. For example, for `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n=2`, the result should be `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`. Handle cases where `n` is larger than the list length.

**Hint**: Use slicing or modulo arithmetic to handle rotations efficiently.

**Apply these ->**: Slicing, modulo operator, list manipulation.
